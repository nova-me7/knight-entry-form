# üõ°Ô∏è Scroll of Valor - Knight Registration Form

Welcome to the **Land of Mystic Knights**! This project is a medieval-themed HTML form titled **Scroll of Valor**, designed to immerse users in a whimsical fantasy experience while they "enlist" as noble knights of the realm.

## ‚ú® Overview

This is a standalone HTML project built with classic `<form>` elements and rich, role-playing inspired copy. Whether you're roleplaying, prototyping a fantasy game, or just having fun ‚Äî this project invites users to fill out their knightly details and swear allegiance to the Crown (or the Rebels, if you're feeling bold).

## üßæ Features

- **Themed Fields**: Users enter their `Knight Name`, `Clan`, `Realm of Origin`, and more.
- **Fantasy Selections**: Choose weapons like a `Frying Pan` or `Magic Staff`, and mounts like a `Dragon` or `Giant Goat`.
- **Whimsical Oaths**: Includes checkboxes for humorous pledges like returning borrowed swords (eventually).
- **Immersive Lore**: Stylized prompts and labels to match a high-fantasy tone.
- **Validation-Ready**: Includes `required` fields and input types to support basic form validation.
